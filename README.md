# Gap-selection-Index--GSI

The Gap Index (GSI) allows identifying the areas in the country with missing information and therefore the sites in which additional sampling will improve knowledge on biodiversity. This approach is carried out following what was proposed by García Márquez et al., 2012 to identify the spatial coverage of biological information in databases, the environmental representativeness of these records, as well as the complementarity of the species in the records. The GSI is quantified using values ​​that range between 0 and 1, with 0 being a well-represented sector, and 0 being the underrepresented areas or areas with greater information gaps.

To obtain it, the index is calculated using the records of species present both in data portals and the information that the Humboldt Institute has compiled in recent years. To calculate it, three dimensions must be estimated: i) a quantification of the biological records per square kilometer, ii) the environmental representativeness of each occurrence following the methodology proposed by Aguiar et al., 2020 and iii) The identification of the complementarity of the species that have records per square kilometer based on first-order Jackknife nonparametric estimates.

The void map was constructed at a resolution of 1 km2. The Institute's geographic data portal (GeoNetwork) is available and can be accessed through the following link

When interpreting the IHEH values, it should be taken into account that:
 - The records obtained for this analysis were downloaded in the first quarter of 2021. To said data set, geographic and taxonomic verification routines were applied that can be consulted in the following links 
    Geographical Verification
    Taxonomic Verification
-  The information obtained in the present analysis does not quantify the level of bias of the information obtained, since the number of records present in a sector may be influenced by its proximity to roads, rivers or other political-administrative units.
